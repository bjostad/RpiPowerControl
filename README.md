# RpiPowerControl

This project is an Arduino nano based controller to properly shutdown the raspberry pi before removing power from the device.
A power status LED is also provided.


Specifically, the goal for this project is to provide working power and reset switches on the SNES (or super Famicom in this case) on a raspberry pi running retropie. Functionality of the two switches should appear to be the same as an original console to the end user.
